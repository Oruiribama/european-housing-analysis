## 🎯 Top-Level Findings

### 1. Eastern European Dominance

**The Pattern:**
- 8 of 12 "hot markets" are in Eastern Europe
- Average growth: 10-15% annually
- Zero to minimal negative quarters

**Key Markets:**

- **Poland**: 10.83% with strong momentum

### 2. The 2023 Crisis and Recovery

**Timeline:**

**2022**: Post-pandemic boom (13.08% average growth)
- Hot markets across Europe
- Low interest rates driving demand
- Unsustainable growth rates

**2023**: Correction year (5.95% average growth)
- ECB aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation
- Luxembourg crashed -14.50%
- Germany declined -10.20%
- Western Europe hit hardest

**2024-2025**: Recovery phase (6.63-6.89% growth)
- Markets adapted to higher rates
- Stabilization at sustainable levels
- Eastern Europe maintained momentum
- Western Europe slowly recovering

**Lesson**: Markets need ~2 years to adjust to major rate changes

### 3. Consistency Champions

**Only 6 countries had ZERO negative quarters:**
1. Bulgaria
2. Croatia  
3. Lithuania
4. Malta
5. Portugal
6. Türkiye (hyperinflation, not real growth)

**Investment Implication**: Consistency matters as much as high growth for risk-adjusted returns.

---

### 4. The Türkiye Anomaly

**The Numbers:**
- 43.70% average growth (2024-2025)
- Peak: 170.50% in 2022-Q4
- By far highest in dataset

**The Reality:**
- NOT healthy growth - hyperinflation
- Turkish Lira lost 75% of value (2021-2024)
- Housing prices rising to preserve wealth
- Real (inflation-adjusted) growth near zero

**Lesson**: High nominal growth ≠ good investment. Context matters.

---

### 5. Volatility Insights

**Most Volatile:**
- Türkiye: 6.24 (hyperinflation swings)
- Hungary: 3.22 (strong but unpredictable)
- Cyprus: 3.14 (small market, big swings)

**Most Stable:**
- Malta: 0.33 (island fortress of consistency)
- Lithuania: 0.65 (Baltic stability)
- Belgium: 0.88 (established market)

**Trade-off**: High volatility often accompanies high growth, but not always. Bulgaria achieved 13.73% growth with only 1.75 volatility.

### 6. Eurozone vs Non-Eurozone Divergence

**2023 Crisis Period:**
- Non-Eurozone averaged 9.52% growth
- Eurozone averaged 5.19% growth
- **Gap: 4.33 percentage points**

**Why Non-Eurozone Won:**
- Currency flexibility (independent rate decisions)
- Eastern European members (Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechia)
- Not locked into ECB's one-size-fits-all policy

**2025 Reversal:**
- First time Eurozone outperformed (2025-Q2)
- Markets converging after divergence
- Shared currency benefits emerging post-crisis

---

### 7. Overheating Detection

**Markets with >15% yearly AND >5% quarterly growth:**
- Türkiye: 9 quarters (hyperinflation)
- Hungary: 1 quarter (2025-Q1 at 17%)
- Bulgaria: 1 quarter (brief spike)

**Historical Context**: 15%+ sustained growth often precedes bubbles
- USA 2005-2007: 15-20% → 2008 crash (-30%)
- Spain 2000-2007: 12-15% → Multi-year decline (-40%)
